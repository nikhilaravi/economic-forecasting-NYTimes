                <p class="page-body-text">
                  Exchange rates are important indicators of real and perceived economic performance.
                  Fluctuations in a country's exchange rate directly reflect changes in economic confidence.
                  This was particularly salient during the recent global financial crisis and Brexit referendum.
                  Furthermore, foreign exchange is one of the most liquid assets traded in global financial markets.
                  This means that any relevant news or development about a country's economy is very quickly reflected in the exchange rate movements, and secondly this also increases the role of trading speculation on affecting the short-term fluctuations of an exchange rate.
                  These properties of exchange rates mean they are very difficult to predict in practice
                </p>
                <p class="method-subheading"> Objectives </p>
                <p class='page-body-text'>
                  In this project, we aim to predict future exchange rates at a weekly level. We apply techniques from time series analysis and natural language processing to identify trends in the exchange rate for prediction. We hypothesise that changes in business news sentiment can be used to predict movements in the exchange rate, leading to more accurate predictors when combined with predictors from time series analysis.

                  Our goal is to build a time series prediction model that incorporates sentiment scores of news articles. We decided to focus on business news as we postulate that news in this segment is most closely related to and affected by exchange rates. Other news segments we considered were politics and world news, however we decided to focus initally on business related news.

                  Through this project we sought to answer a few key questions:
                  <ul class='page-body-text'>
                    <li>How accurately can next week's exchange rate be predicted using only past values of exchange rate? What form would such a time series predictive model take?</li>
                    <li>Can a sentiment "signal" be extracted from news articles over a period of time and what would this signal look like?</li>
                    <li>Can the sentiment signal be incorporated into the time series predictive model, and if so does it improve the predictive accuracy of the model?</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="method-subheading"> Approach </p>
                <p class='page-body-text'>
                  We began our study by collecting UK/US exchange rate data and business news articles in the period 2010-2016.

                  The subsequent analysis involved two components. The first was a univariate time series predictive model of the exchange rate data. The second was a sentiment analysis algorithm to determine the weekly business sentiment score.

                  The results of this analyis formed the creation of a multivariate time series model incorporating sentiment scores.

                  The predictive accuracies of the models were compared the models were used to generate a one week forecast of the exchange rate.

We performed a series of exploratory analyses on the data to determine the frequency at which the data is needed in order for important movements in the exchange rate to be captured (such as the financial crisis and brexit). It was determined that weekly frequency was sufficient and the data was aggregated to the weekly level. This data is plotted below:

                  <p class='method-subheading'>1. Selection of Relevant Articles</p>
                  <p>
                    From all the articles scrapped using an API of The Guardian newspaper, we first filtered based on relevance to exchange rates. This firstly involved building a small dictionary of words and phrases which would indicate relevance to exchnage rates. Then the contents of this dictionary was searched for in all the articles. We decided to filter the articles based on relevance to exchange rates, by considering the number of terms (our relevance threshold) from our exchange rate dictionary which were found in the articles. We visualised the average number of relevant articles weekly under different relevance thresholds (where a higher threshold results in a lower number of articles). After considering different relevance threshold values, we determined the optimal threshold to be 3 words. This was decided by ensuring that a sufficient number of articles were classed as relevant weekly in order to generate weekly sentiment scores (such that no week had zero relevant articles), whilst also ensuring an excessive number of irrelevant articles were excluded.
                    <div class="container">
                      <img class='image-graph' align="middle" src='./img/relevant_article_thresholds.png'/>

                  </p>
                  <p class='method-subheading'>2. Tokenizing</p>
                  <p class='method-subsubheading'>Splitting article body into sentences, then into words</p>
                  <p>
                    SentinetWordNet provides a trained index of words and their corresponding positive, negtiave and netural sentiments (where the sum of these sentiments equal 1). To generate sentiments at an article level, we tokenised articles into words and used the mean average sentiment as the sentiment score for the entire article.
                    A potential problem behind this method is that we may not obtain accurate sentiments for sections of the article which depend on more sophisticated understanding of the natural language at a phrase or sentence level. However, given the computation time required to use more sophisticated natural language processing techniques (such as Word2Vec or Doc2Vec) and the total number of articles to be considered across the time period, we proceed with the simpler model.
                  </p>
                  <p class='method-subheading'>3. Filtering Neutrality</p>
                  <p class='method-subsubheading'>Removing sentences with neutral sentiment from the original article</p>
                  <p>
                    Given each article, we removed any sentences which had very high neutal sentiment scores. This ensured that our sentiment score generator would only focus on sentences which implied strong sentiment, resolving a previous problem of obtaining very low positive/negative sentiment scores from our model. We also investigated what neutal sentiment scores would be the most effective for removing neutral sentiment sentences. This was done by considering different neutal sentiment score thresholds for sentence removals. For each of these thresholds, we calculated the sentiment scores of the articles (with neutral sentences removed) at a weekly level. Then this time series of positive and negative sentiment scores was compared with the exchange rate time series to obtain correlation values. We chose the optimal neutal sentiment score threshold by maximising the magnitude of correlation values. This gave an optimal neutal sentiment score threshold of 0.9.

                  <p class='method-subheading'>4. Weekly sentiment</p>
                  <p class='method-subsubheading'>Averaging article sentiments at a weekly level to obtain weekly sentiment scores.</p>
                  <p>
                    Having developed a method to generate sentiment scores for a given article, we simply took the mean average of the articles at a given week to generate the sentiment scores associated to that week. For future work, it may be worth considering potential ways to weight different articles' sentiments based on factors such as their popularity.
                  </p>
                  <p class='method-subheading'>5. Smoothing</p>
                  <p class='method-subsubheading'>Reducing the weekly variance of sentiment scores with a rolling average</p>
                  <p>
                    Having generated weekly sentiment scores, initially the high weekly variance did not allow any visible trends to be noticed. We resolved this by smoothing the weekly sentiment scores using a rolling average of a fixed number of preceding weeks. This idea has a natural motivation, which is that overall sentiment on a given week is also dependant on the sentiment of the previous few weeks. The optimal number of preceding weeks used to smoothen the scentiment scores was chosen by maximising the correlation between the exchange rate and the sentiment score time series. The smoothened sentiment scores now show visible correlation with the exchange rate, especially during times such as the Brexit Referendum. This is shown below.

                  <p>
                    Let's take a look again at the exchange rate plot, zooming in on times of interest
                  </p>
                  <img class='image-graph' align="middle" src='./img/full_exchange.png'/>
                  <p>
                    First, take a look at the global financial crisis, and event that preciptated a drastic change in the UK-US exchange rate
                  </p>
                  <img class='image-graph' align="middle" src='./img/fincrisis.png'/>
                  <p>
                    Next, take a look at the at the time period around the Brexit referendum, which saw the value of the GBP at a local minimum relative to a 25 year time horizon
                  </p>
                  <img class='image-graph' align="middle" src='./img/brexit.png'/>
                  <p class='method-subheading'>Stationarity</p>
                  <p>
                    An important assumption in much of models underlying time series analysis is that the mean and variance of the data data do not change
                    over time; if the data has an underlying trend, this will certainly not be true.  As such, most time series
                    analysis occurs on data rendered stationary, traditionally by taking first differences. After differencing, we
                     see that aside from a time of extreme variation around the global financial crisis,
                      data is reasonably stationary with mean zero and relatively stable variance outside of the 2008-2010 time frame.
                      Keeping the anomalies of the financial crisis in mind, we can move on to the next segment in building our model.

                  <p>
                    Let's first start by taking a deeper dive into the first lag of the first-differenced
                    exchange rate as this should give us some information as to whether or not a simple
                    AR(1) process can adequately model our data.  If we see a non-zero slope to the correlation plot,
                    we can infer that there is, in fact, a good relationship between this week's exchange rate and last week's
                    exchange rate.
                  </p>
                  <img class='image-graph' align="middle" src='./img/joint.png'/>
                  <p>
                    The first difference is almost certainly zero, with both axes having data appearing to be drawn
                    from a roughly normal distribution with mean zero.  There does not appear to be much gleaned from relying entirely
                    on the first lag.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Let's now take a look at further lags (lags 2 through 40) to see if there's any other information thats's available in prior lags.
                  </p>
                  <img class='image-graph' align="middle" src='./img/autocorrelation.png'/>
                  <p>
                    The lags appear to bounce around zero--an AR process might not be able to glean all that
                    much from the underlying data, although regularization might improve this, which we will discuss in a later segment.
                  </p>
                  <p class='method-heading'>Univariate ARMA models</p>
                  <p>
                    Although we saw from the autocorrelation plot investigation above that AR processes will likely perform trivially,
                    there's still a need to create a well-developed baseline model against which we will compare our sentiment score-augmented
                    model.

                  <p>
                    ARIMA models are set of time series methods that include autoregressive components (AR), differencing (I), and
                    moving average terms (MA) in order to capture various dimensions by which time series trends can be described.

                  <p class='method-subheading'>AR model</p>
                  <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, AR terms capture the number of lags to be used by the model. Here, we select an AR(6) process
                    as the sixth lag is somewhat significant in both the ACF and PACF plots above.  The AR(6) process appears to perform quite well (although
                    we should remember that exchange rates do not vary all too much week over week).

                  <p class='method-subheading'>MA model</p>
                  <p>

                    We also considered a standalone moving average model (using two moving average terms) for the sake of exploration.
                    This appeared to attenuate the magnitude of our predictions and lead to a poor model result.

                  <p>
                    Our final baseline model was an combined ARMA (6,5) process that yielded the lowest SSR on the data, with a plot of the prediction
                    overlayed on the original data below.

                  <p class='method-heading'>Lasso regression model</p>
                  <p>
                    An alternative time series modelling approach was considered involving using linear regression techniques. Matrices of predictors were generated with the lagged exchange rate data and this was used with Lasso regression to determine the coefficients of the lags. The data was of the form:
                  </p>
                  <p class='method-subheading'>1. Create a matrix of lagged predictors </p>
                  <p>For further improvements from the baseline model, several other models were considered including regression models with L1 and L2 regularisation.  This is equivalent to an autoregressive model and would enable us to examine the coefficients assigned to each lag.
                  </p>
                  <img class='equation' align="middle" src='./img/formula.png'/>
                  <p>
                  To determine the number of lags used in our model, we split the given data into training and test sets and analysed the cross validation scores. This is gave 20 lags as being the optimal choice, as shown in the matrix above.
                  </p>
                  <p class='method-subheading'>2. Split into test and train sets and analyse model forecasts</p>

                  <p class='method-subheading'>3. Use lasso regression to fit a model to the training data</p>
                  <p>
                    Having chosen the number of lags, we now fit a lasso regression model on the training data. We choose to use the lasso because it would give sparse coefficients in our prediction lag variables, so that potential interpretations can be made after the fit.
                    Cross validated Lasso regression was used to optimise the hyperparameters.
                  </p>
                  <p class='method-subheading'>4a. Visualising the predictions on the test set</p>
                  <p>We first visualise the predictions from the lasso model on the test set, to obtain a sense of the overall fit compared to the actual data</p>
                  <img class='image-graph' align="middle" src='./img/test_prediction.png'/>
                  <p>As visualised above, our predictions are close to the actual exchange rates on the test set</p>
                  <p class='method-subheading'>4b. The regression coefficients of the fitted mode</p>
                  <p>We can analyse which of the time lags are the most significant in our model, by considering the fitted regression coefficients</p>
                  <img class='image-graph' align="middle" src='./img/lasso_coeffs.png'/>
                  <p>
                    Visualisation of the coefficient values shows that beyond the first lag, the subsequent lags have little predictive value. Lasso regression squashes the predictive power of some coefficients in favour of others, and in this case has put all the predictive power in the first lag.
                  </p>
                  <p class='method-subheading'>4c. Residual errors of the model</p>
                  <p>We can analyse the distribution of the residual errors of the model</p>
                  <img class='image-graph' align="middle" src='./img/lasso_residuals.png'/>
                  <p>The residual errors have a distribution with mean approximately zero. This means on average our prediction model does not under or overestimate the actual values.</p>


                  <p class='method-heading'>Multivariate Lasso regression</p>
                  <p>A predictor matrix of containing 20 lags of preceeding exchange rate, 20 lags of preceding positive sentiment scores, and 20 lags of preceding negative sentiment scores was constructed of the form</p>
                  <img class='equation' align="middle" src='./img/matrix_of_lags.png'/>
                  <p>
                  As highlighted above, the first 20 columns of the matrix correspond to the exchange rate time series, the next 20 columns of the matrix correspond to the positive sentiment scores, and the last 20 columns of the matrix correspond to the negative sentiment scores.
                  </p>
                  <p>Again we can analyse which of the time lags and the positive/ negative sentiment lags are the most significant in our model, by considering the fitted regression coefficients</p>
                  <img class='image-graph' align="middle" src='./img/lasso_coeffs_sentiment.png'/>
                  <p class='method-subheading'>Residual errors of the model</p>
                  <p>We can again analyse the distribution of the residual errors of the model</p>
                  <img class='image-graph' align="middle" src='./img/lasso_sentiment_residuals.png'/>
                  <p>The residual errors have a distribution with mean approximately zero. This means on average our prediction model does not under or overestimate the actual values.</p>
                  <p class='method-heading'>Model Comparison</p>
                  <p>Finally, we consider the R^2 values of the different models considered for comparison with our final foreact model which incorporated the sentiment scores.</p>
                  <img class='image-graph' align="middle" src='./img/model_comparison.png'/>
                  <p> There is little increase in the predictive accuracy of the model with the incorporation of sentiment scores, showing that a baseline univariate model is in fact equally as useful as a more complex model with a larger predictor space</p>

                  <p class='method-heading'>Forecast Methodology</p>
                  <p>Exchange rate forecasts were generated in an incremental process:</p>
                  <p> 1. The lags of time step t were used to generate a prediction for time step t+1 </p>
                  <p> 2. This was used as the best estimate of the exchange rate at time t+1 and used as one of the predictors to predict the value of the exchange rate at time t+2 </p>
                  <p> This incremental forecasting process was continued up to the desired forecasting horizon. It is important to note that at each forecasting step, the error increases significantly and the confidence bounds after even 2 time steps forecasts are large.
                  The plot below shows 20 week forecasts generated from each time point. The forecasts are shown as the coloured lines.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <img class='forecast' align="middle" src='./img/20_week_forecast.png'/>
                <p>The forecasts are seen to have very little predictive accuracy beyond predicting 1-2 weeks in the future. This result is unsurprising. Given the inherent unpredictable nature of exchange rates and their sensitivity to changes in the world, it would be unrealistic to expect that the exchange rate could be forecasted several weeks or months into the future.

                Looking more closely at the direction of prediction, during the sharp fall in exchange rates during the financial crisis (late 2008), the predictions are in the positive direction, and it takes several months before the direction of prediction aligns with the local direction of movement. Following the financial crisis, the predictions all show the value decreasing from the value at the local time point. This analysis shows that long horizon forecasts of the exchange rate are difficult and most probably inaccurate.

              In this project our goal was to predict future exchange rates at a weekly level. Using techniques from time series analysis and SentiWordNet, we developed models for exchange rate prediction which incorporated weekly sentiment scores from relevant news articles. As hypothesised, we found that incorporating sentiment scores into the time series model gives an improvement in prediction accuracy. A final comparison of our prediction model (incorporating sentiment scores) with a time series model not incorporating sentiment scores and a simple baseline model is highlighted in the table below.
